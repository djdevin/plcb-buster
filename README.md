The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board has made the COVID-19 pandemic even more dangerous by forcing residents to drive across the border to purchase alcohol: https://reason.com/2020/04/07/pennsylvania-has-made-it-both-difficult-and-dangerous-to-buy-liquor/

The situation is so bad that neighboring states are banning PA residents: https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/15/us/pennsylvania-liquor-sales-ohio-west-virginia-trnd/index.html

Restaurants are in trouble because of the PLCB's archaic prohibition-era laws: https://www.inquirer.com/business/wine-importers-lawsuit-plcb-liquor-control-direct-shipping-20200416.html

Online sales are open, but the PLCB has severely restricted sales to only a select few that are randomly selected: https://www.post-gazette.com/life/drinks/2020/04/15/PA-PLCB-special-order-sales-online-wine-spirits/stories/202004150059

There are really easy solutions to this: https://www.fox43.com/article/news/local/state-lawmakers-look-to-fix-failed-liquor-control-board-system-allow-curbside-pickup/521-386a4fd2-38e9-44de-9c9b-bd53eee8564e

I recommend not purchasing from the PLCB stores and instead buying safely from local distilleries, breweries, and wineries, or ordering online from out of state.

But if the state store is your only option, you should not be forced to endanger the welfare of others because the PLCB cannot manage a business. The PLCB needs to innovate as other businesses are doing during this trying time.

So if you must buy from the PLCB online store...

There's no exploits happening, just clearing your cookies and asking the PLCB for a new roll of the dice.
